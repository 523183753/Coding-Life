## Section 2 - Introduction to C# and .NET Framework

### C# vs .NET

C# is a programming language, while .NET is a framework that builds applications on Windows.

There are different languages that can target at .NET Framework such as F# or VB.NET.

### .NET

.NET consists of two parts:

- CLR (Common Language Runtime)
- Class Library

### CLR

1. .NET translate C# code into intermediate language code, this idea borrowed from Java. The IL code is independent of the computer which it is running.
1. Then CLR translate IL code into native/machine code, this process is called JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation.
1. So, we just write code, and CLR will do all the following job to make the program run on different systems.

### Architecture of .NET Applications

- Application consists of classes.
- Namespace is a container for related classes. For example, the namespace `System` in .NET Framework consists of classes such as `Array`, `Console`, and so on.
- Assembly (DLL or EXE) is a container for related namespaces. For example, in `c:\WINDOWS\assembly\GAC_MSIL\`, there are hundreds of DLLs, such as `System.Core`, `System.Drawing`, `System.Net`, and so on.
- And application is a container for one or many assemblies. When compiling application, the compiler builds one or more assemblies depending on how the code is partitioned.

## Section 3 - Primitive Types and Expressions

### Naming Conventions

local variables: Camel Case -- `int firstNumber;`
constants: Pascal Case -- `const int MaxSize = 5;`

### Real Numbers

The default type is double, so if you declare `float time = 1.2;`, the code will not compile. You should declare `float time = 1.2f;` instead.

### Overflowing

```c#
byte number = 255;
number = number + 1; // 0
```

How to check?

```c#
checked
{
  byte number = 255;
  number = number + 1;
}
```

### Tricks

1. Enter `cw` and press `Tab`, Visual Studio will autocomplete and display `Console.WriteLine();`.
1. Press `Ctrl+X` at a line, and this line will be deleted.

### Implicit Type Conversion

Convert byte to int will always be OK, because no data loss.
And convert int to byte is disabled by default, if must, do like `byte b = (byte) i`, which is casting.

### Logical Operations

When there are two negatives in the code, DO convert to two positives.

### Comments

When to use? To explain whys, hows, constrains, etc. not the whats.

## Section 4 - Non-Primitive Types

Non-primitive types like class need to explicit allocate memory as follows.

```c#
Person person = new Person();
```

### Static Modifier

When we only want one instance of a property or method, we use `static` modifier as follows.

```c#
Class Calculator {
  public static int Add() {...}
}

int sum = Calculator.Add(1, 2);
```
