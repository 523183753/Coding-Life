## Section 2 - Introduction to C# and .NET Framework

### C# vs .NET

C# is a programming language, while .NET is a framework that builds applications on Windows.

### .NET

- CLR (Common Language Runtime)
- Class Library

### CLR

1. .NET translate C# code into intermediate language code, this idea borrowed from Java.
2. Then CLR translate IL code into native/machine code, this process is called JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation.

### Architecture of .NET Applications

Application consists of classes.
- Namespace is a container for related classes.
- Assembly (DLL or EXE) is a container for related namespaces.
- And application is a container for one or many assembly.

## Section 3 - Primitive Types and Expressions

### Naming Conventions

local variables: Camel Case -- `int firstNumber;`
constants: Pascal Case -- `const int MaxSize = 5;`

### Real Numbers

The default type is double, so if you declare `float time = 1.2;`, the code will not compile. You should declare `float time = 1.2f;` instead.

### Overflowing

```
byte number = 255;
number = number + 1; // 0
```

How to check?

```
checked
{
  byte number = 255;
  number = number + 1;
}
```

### Tricks

1. Enter `cw` and press `Tab`, Visual Studio will autocomplete and display `Console.WriteLine();`.
2. Press `Ctrl+X` at a line, and this line will be deleted.

### Implicit Type Conversion
Convert byte to int will always be OK, because no data loss.
And convert int to byte is disabled by default, if must, do like `byte b = (byte) i`, which is casting.

### Logical Operations

When there are two negatives in the code, DO convert to two positives.

### Comments

When to use? To explain whys, hows, constrains, etc. not the whats.

## Section 4 - Non-Primitive Types

Non-primitive types like class need to explicit allocate memory as follows.

```
Person person = new Person();
```

### Static Modifier

When we only want one instance of a property or method, we use `static` modifier as follows.

```
Class Calculator {
  public static int Add() {...}
}

int sum = Calculator.Add(1, 2);
```
